## Notes

- All items pass. Spec is ready for `/sp.plan`.
- 4 user stories defined: US1 (Session Setup), US2 (Monitoring), US3 (Auto-Post), US4 (Scheduler Integration)
- 21 functional requirements across 5 concern areas
- 7 measurable success criteria
- Character limit (280) is the single most critical constraint — enforced in FR-011 and SC-004
